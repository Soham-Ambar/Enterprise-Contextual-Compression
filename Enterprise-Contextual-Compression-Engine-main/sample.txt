All financial transactions are classified according to risk levels. Low-risk transactions are those below $1,000. Medium-risk transactions range from $1,000 to $10,000. High-risk transactions exceed $10,000 and require enhanced due diligence.

Transactions above $50,000 are automatically flagged as critical risk and trigger comprehensive risk assessment procedures. The risk assessment must be completed within 4 hours of transaction initiation.

2.2 Fraud Detection Thresholds

The system automatically monitors for suspicious activity patterns. Any single transaction exceeding $15,000 triggers immediate fraud detection protocols. Multiple transactions totaling $20,000 within a 24-hour period will also activate fraud prevention measures.

Account activity showing unusual patterns, such as 5 or more transactions exceeding $5,000 within a single day, will result in temporary account suspension pending investigation. The investigation must be completed within 48 hours.

Portfolio exposure to any single asset class cannot exceed 30% of total portfolio value. The maximum leverage ratio allowed is 3:1. Positions exceeding these limits must be reduced within 5 business days or face automatic liquidation.
